# DA526 Image processing with machine learning

Cloud segmentation on Landsat dataset using UNet architecture.

The usage of Landsat datasets in study and monitoring of earth is done by fields of Geoscience.

- Implementation of UNet architecture on the dataset for training and testing of the model.
- Experimented with various loss functions to achieve better accuracy.
- Also used a pretrained model Mask-RCNN and created an interface using Hugging face for object segmentation.

for instance segmentation, I have used Matterport-Mask RCNN files from google drive and mount the drive to colab, run the code for GUI for input and output images.
